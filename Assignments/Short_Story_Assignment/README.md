# Explainable AI in Data Mining: Bridging Transparency and Decision-Making

## Abstract
Explainable AI (XAI) is revolutionizing data mining by making complex machine learning models interpretable and transparent. This paper explores key XAI techniques like LIME, SHAP, and model-specific approaches, emphasizing their role in enhancing trust and accountability in critical domains like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement. The study also discusses challenges and future directions, including the integration of domain knowledge and ethical considerations.

## Features
- Overview of XAI techniques for data mining.
- Real-world applications in healthcare, finance, and law enforcement.
- Challenges and future research opportunities.
